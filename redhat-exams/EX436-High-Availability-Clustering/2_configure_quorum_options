#WHAT IS QURUM


#QUORUM OPTIONS

last_man_standing:
------------------
This option will allow for a cluster to operate with a lower number of nodes from the ones expected. 
It will determine wich group (partition) of nodes should be operational.

last_man_standing_window:
-------------------------
You give a specific time window for the "last_man_standing" to make a decision on which group of nodes
should remain operational.


wait_for_all:
-------------
It knows the original number of nodes in a cluster and it expects for all of them to be operational.
However if a node or group of nodes goes down, this option is ignored so "last_man_standing" will take
over, if the latter is enabled that is.


auto_tie_breaker:
-----------------
When enabled the cluster can operate with half of the nodes being operational. 
This option is used when there is an even number of nodes.
